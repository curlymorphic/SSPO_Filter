# SSPO_Filter

A simple audio plugin implementing the classical biquad filters. 
This is my first Juce plugin and as such provides no advantages over the swams of exisitng variants, other than a self learning project.
This has only been tested on a windows 10 PC, using Ableton 10.1.5 as a VST3, however this may work as any format or platform supported by juce.

Requires JUCE v5.4.5, and already containing the farbot realtime code.
